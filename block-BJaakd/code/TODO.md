1. Create a promise. Have it resolve with a value of `Promise Resolved!` in resolve after a delay of 1000ms, using `setTimeout`. Print the contents of the promise after it has been resolved by passing `console.log` to `.then`

```js
let promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(()=> resolved(`Promise Resolved!`);, 1000)
});
```

2. Create another promise. Now have it reject with a value of `Rejected Promise!` without using `setTimeout`. Print the contents of the promise after it has been rejected by passing console.log to `.catch`

```js
let promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  reject(`Rejected Promise!`);
});

promise.catch((err) => console.log(err));
```

3. Create another promise. Now have it reject with a value of `Rejected Promise!` without using `setTimeout`. Print the contents of the promise after it has been rejected by passing console.log to `.catch` and also use `.finally` to log message `Promise Settled!`.

```js
let promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  reject(`Rejected Promise!`);
});

promise
  .catch((err) => console.log(err))
  .finally(() => console.log("Promise Settled!"));
```

4. What will be the output of the code below.

```js
console.log("A");

// Asynchronous code finises in 0 seconds (Callback Queue)
setTimeout(() => console.log("B"), 0); // callback queue

// A promise that resolves right away (Microtask Queue)
Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log("C"));

console.log("D");

//Output
//A
//D
//C
//B
```

5. Write a function named `wait` that accepts `time` in ms returns a promise. The promise gets resolved after given time.

```js
function wait(time) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => resolve("The Promise Resolved"), time);
  });
}

wait(1000).then((res) => console.log(res));
```

6. Do the following:

- Create a new promise
- Resolve with 21
- Use `.then` and return adding `10` to the value you will get as parameter
- Use `.then` and return adding `100` to the value you will get as parameter
- Use `.then` and check if the value you get is greater than `100` throw new error with any message
- Catch the error using `.catch`

```js
let promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  resolve(21);
})
  .then((value) => {
    return value + 10;
  })
  .then((value) => {
    return value + 100;
  })
  .then((value) => {
    if (value > 100) throw new Error("Value is Greater than 100");
  })
  .catch((err) => console.log(err));
```

7. Do the following:

- Create a new promise
- Resolve the promise with `['A']`
- Use `.then` and concat `B` into the parameter and return
- Use `.then` and return and object like `{0: 'A', 1: 'B'}`
- Use `.then` and log the value

```js
let promise = new Promise((resolved, reject) => {
  resolved(["A"]);
})
  .then((value) => {
    return value.concat(`B`);
  })
  .then((value) => {
    return value.reduce((acc, cv, i) => {
      acc[i] = cv;
      return acc;
    });
  }, {})
  .then((value) => {
    console.log(value);
  });
```

8. Do the following:

- Create a new promise named `first` and resolve it with `1`
- Use `.then` on `first` and return `2` also check the value you get access to by logging
- Chain `.then` on above and return `3` also check the value you get access to by logging
- Chain `.then` on above and return `4` also check the value you get access to by logging

```js
let first = new Promise((resolved, reject) => {
  resolved(1);
})
  .then((value) => {
    console.log(value);
    return 2;
  })
  .then((value) => {
    console.log(value);
    return 3;
  })
  .then((value) => {
    console.log(value);
    return 4;
  });
```

9. Do the following:

- Create a new promise named `first` and resolve it with `1`
- Use `.then` on `first` and return `2` also check the value you get access to by logging
- Use `.then` on `first` and return `3` also check the value you get access to by logging
- Use `.then` on `first` and return `4` also check the value you get access to by logging

```js
let first = new Promise((res, rej) => {
  res(1);
});
first.then((value) => {
  console.log(value);
  return "2";
});
first.then((value) => {
  console.log(value);
  return `3`;
});
first.then((value) => {
  console.log(value);
  return `4`;
});
```

10. Try to understand the difference between the problem 8 and 9. Write your observation.
    > In problem 8 it logs the return value where as in problem 9 it logs value 2 as it is been returned in the first then .
11. Do the following

- Create a promise and resolve it with `John`
- Use `.then` and return another promise that resolves with `Arya`
- Use `.then` log the value you get access to and return another promise that resolves after 2000ms with value `Bran`
- Use `.then` to log the value

```js
let promise = new Promise((resolved, reject) => {
  resolved(`John`);
}).then((value) => {
  return new Promise((resolved, reject) => {
    resolved(`Arya`);
  }).then((value) => {
    return new Promise((resolved, reject) => {
      setTimeout(() => resolved(`Bran`), 2000);
    }).then((value) => {
      console.log(value);
    });
  });
});
```
